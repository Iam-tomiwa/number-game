		<h1>HOW TO PLAY</h1>
		<hr>
		<div class="instructions">
			This game is usually played with 4 digits, but can also be played with 3 or any other number of digits. We'd be using 4 digits in this game.
			At the beginning, a 4-digit number is secretely picked by the computer. The digits would be all different. Then, you try to guess the computer's number who gives the number of matches. If the matching digits are in their right positions, they are "dead", if in different positions, they are "wounded". Example:
			<ul>
				<li>Secret number: 4271</li>
				<li>Your try: 1234</li>
				<li>Answer: 1 dead and 2 wounded. (The dead is "2", the wounded are "4" and "1".) </li>
			</ul>
			You must correctly give the computer's secret number in the right order within 7 guesses to win the game. <br>
			Basic Rules :
			<ul>
				<li>All four digits are different</li>
				<li>Number cannot begin with 0</li>
			</ul>
			Goodluck.
